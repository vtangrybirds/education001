Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (commonly shortened to Alice in Wonderland) is an 1865 novel written by English mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells of a girl named Alice falling through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children.[1] It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre.[1][2] Its narrative course and structure, characters and imagery have been enormously influential[2] in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.
